## Benefits of Managing your Research Data

For a researcher, having an effective plan and approach for the management of your data is important for several reasons:

- Find and understand the data
- Avoid unnecessary duplications
- Validate your results, if required
- Ensure your research is visible and has impact
- Get credit when others cite your work
- Comply with Founder mandates

A Data Management System like openBIS can help you solve these topics.

Check our documentation about openBIS `[here](/rdm/openbis/)`.

### Walkthrough Guide from EPFL
From planning to preservation, use this [introductory guide](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/library/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/RDM_Walkthrough_Guide_20190930.pdf) to Research Data Management, with links to online resources and practical suggestions (created by EPFL).

## Love Data Week
The Love Data Week is an international event that aims to raise awareness about Research Data Management (RDM) among research communities.
Click [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/about/cms/3799) for more information.

### Horror Stories
During the 2020 edition of Love Data week, the EPFL Library Research Data team prepared 5 short RDM Horror Stories for you.
Inspired by EPFL labs, the 5-episode series presents you some situations that researchers may find themselves confronted with in their daily research activities.
Maybe you have already faced one of these situations? Discover the [5 episodes on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_rEXpfCTrg&list=PLPkfOHxsjx2hH-QmfYp_ZHZI2WmE6pXLv&index=3)!

## In-depth practise guide
The practise guide you can find [here](https://www.empa.ch/web/s909/in-depth-overview-best-practise-guide-) is intended to provide Empa researchers with a guideline on how to organize, capture, store, preserve and share research data.

It provides the "best practice" concerning RDM, compiled from various sources.
It is not a binding document for Empa employees.
Every researcher has to take care to comply with the legal requirements – especially from funding agencies such as SNSF and EU founded projects but also with the Empa Management Handbook (MHB).

The best practise guide has been written by **Matthias Rösslein**, senior scientist at Empa.
It should be a living document that is actually used in practice and helpful to our researchers.
Any feedback on the guide is therefore welcome and could be included in future versions.
