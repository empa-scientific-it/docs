## Benefits of Managing your Research Data

For a researcher, having an effective plan and approach for data management, is important for several reasons:

- Finding and understanding the data
- Avoiding unnecessary duplications
- Validating your results, if required
- Ensuring your research is visible and has impact
- Getting credit when others cite your work
- Complying with Founder mandates

A Data Management System like openBIS can help you solve these topics.
Check our documentation about openBIS [here](/documentation/openbis/).

Check out the Empa support for DMP template for SNF [here](/services/research-data-management/data_management_plan#dmp-templates-and-support).

## RDM guidelines by EPFL

- **Infographics:**

  Check out [here](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/server/api/core/bitstreams/fc3bac30-1f3f-49f3-9288-48142ba423e9/content) the information provided by EPFL regarding FAIR Data Principles, Cost of RDM, File Formats, Data Management Plan (DMP), and more.

- **Walkthrough Guide:**

  From planning to preservation, use this [introductory guide](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/library/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/RDM_Walkthrough_Guide_20190930.pdf) to Research Data Management, with links to online resources and practical suggestions (created by EPFL).

## Love Data Week
The Love Data Week is an international event that aims to raise awareness about Research Data Management (RDM) among research communities.
Click [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/about/cms/3799) for more information.

## In-depth practice guide
The practice guide you can find [here](https://www.empa.ch/web/s909/in-depth-overview-best-practise-guide-) is intended to provide Empa researchers with a guideline on how to organize, capture, store, preserve and share research data.

It provides the "best practice" concerning RDM, compiled from various sources.
It is not a binding document for Empa employees.
Every researcher has to take care to comply with the legal requirements – especially from funding agencies such as SNSF and EU founded projects but also with the Empa Management Handbook (MHB).

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  The best practice guide has been written by **Matthias Rösslein**, senior scientist at Empa.
  It should be a living document that is actually used in practice and helpful to our researchers.
  Any feedback on the guide is therefore welcome and could be included in future versions.
