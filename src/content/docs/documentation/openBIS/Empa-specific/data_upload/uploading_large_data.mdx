## Introduction

OpenBIS is designed to store both the data and the metadata from your research project. The metadata usually describes **how** you performed your study, while the data contains the measurements and observations in your experiments. These are often very large files, that the [data upload via ELN UI](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/data-upload.html#data-upload-via-web-ui) cannot handle reliably, which is the case for files larger than 10 GB.

To upload larger datasets (> 10GB), we offer another way through Empa's `N:` drive where you can simply drag and drop your files in a lab related folder and after a delay of approx. 20 minutes the upload appears as an attachment on your chosen openBIS entity (e.g. collection, object etc.).

To learn how to upload large data to openBIS, which is called `data upload via (ELN-LIMS) dropbox` by ETH, please follow the instructions below.

## Instructions

1. First, you need to decide which upload strategy you want to adopt:

   - **auto**: openBIS continuously monitors the upload directory named auto and when a new file appears it is automatically moved to openBIS as an attachment after a predefined inactivity period (usually 20 minutes). This waiting time is added to prevent the system to start an upload while a large file is still being copied to the upload directory.
   - **marker**: the upload to openBIS is started when the system sees a special file called [marker file](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/data-upload.html#dropbox-with-markerfile). This is ideal to upload very large files which can take long time to move to the upload directory.

1. Then, you need to find the upload folder for your openBIS group. On your Empa machine, go to `N:` drive and see  folders named after the following structure: `OB-LXXX-Groupname`

   - `XXX` is the ID of your instance, which corresponds to the number of your department.
   - `Groupname` is the name of the openBIS group you belong to. It can be a name chosen by your lab members when setting up openBIS or the default name  `AbtXXX` where `XXX` is the official lab number. For example, for the department 502, we have `OB-502AIM` for the `AIM` group of lab 502, as shown in the screenshot.

1. Open the [ELN UI browser of your lab](/documentation/openbis/pages_for_labs/), choose the right [login](/documentation/openbis/getting-started/login/), and navigate to the entity ([object or experiment/collection](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/lab-notebook.html)) where you want to upload data. In this example, we want to upload a file to the collection `Creep measurements` of Maurice Biot's lab notebook.

1. Follow the [instructions in this link](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/data-upload.html#data-upload-via-dropbox) to create the folder connected to the upload place in openBIS (e.g. collection `Creep measurements`) and if needed the marker file with the correct naming (in case of the marker upload option). When following the instructions, **be aware that ETH documentation calls the folder in N:drive (e.g. `OB-502AIM` or `OB-L207-Abt207`) the _eln-lims-dropbox_ folder**. Depending on the upload version you will use on `N:` drive in the folder `OB-LXXX-Groupname` (e.g. `OB-502AIM` or `OB-L207-Abt207`) the already existing folders `auto` or `marker`:

    ![auto folder](src/assets/openBIS/Bild/auto_folder.png)

1. When you created all folders in the right place according to the instructions above, you can move your data files or data directory inside.

1. Data files will be automatically uploaded to openBIS after the following timeframe depending on the upload option auto or marker:

   - auto: 20 minutes after nothing happend anymore in the folder auto
   - marker: Shortly after the marker file appeared in the right folder

1. Check via [Dropbox monitor](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/data-upload.html#dropbox-monitor) the status of the data upload.

It is also possible to **register metadata for datasets** via this so called `dropbox upload`, which was described above. Check the instructions [here](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/data-upload.html#registration-of-metadata-for-datasets-via-dropbox).
