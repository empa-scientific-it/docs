1. Instance Admin: The person in your group who is responsible for openBIS and who helped you to attend the training.
2. Check [lab pages](/documentation/openbis/pages_for_labs/) if your lab already has openBIS:
   - If yes, you need to contact the Instance Admin in your lab to get access
   - If not, use our contact [e-mail](mailto:openbis-support@empa.ch) to learn about the steps to get an openBIS instance for your lab (Here is the demo from openBIS on the official openBIS page [here](https://openbis.ch/index.php/demo/#demo))
3. For more in-depth information:
   - Chapter [Empa-specific](/documentation/openbis/empa-specific/)
   - Chapter How-to and Use Cases e.g. [Programming in openBIS](/documentation/openbis/how-to-and-use-cases/programming/)
4. For more detailed questions check our [Support](/documentation/openbis/getting-started/support/).
5. Get more ideas via interaction with the [Community](/documentation/openbis/getting-started/community/).
