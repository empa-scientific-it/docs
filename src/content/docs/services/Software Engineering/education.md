## Python Tutorial

We offer Python tutorials twice per year.
First, one for beginners, and then, an advanced one.
The exact dates and the modality are communicated in advance through an Empa-wide newsletter.

The material for the tutorial, including interactive exercises for self-learning, is published on GitHub and is publicly accessible.
You can access the material [here](https://github.com/empa-scientific-it/python-tutorial).
