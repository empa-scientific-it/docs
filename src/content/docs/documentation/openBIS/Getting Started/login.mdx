## Two Interfaces
**Links to openBIS of your lab [here](../../pages-for-labs).** 

- ELN User Interface (**ELN UI**): Main interface for managing your data
- Admin (User) Interface (**Admin UI**): Interface for set up of meta data structure (only for Admins)

## Two login options

- **As an User** with your Empa credentials via single sign on (works via [SWTICHaai](https://www.switch.ch/aai/))
- **As an Instance Admin** with the credentials you get after sending the support form for new Instance Admins [here](../../support) 

<Aside type="caution" title="Warning">
    You can login to the Admin UI with as User and Instance Admin, but as User you will NOT have permission to save any changes in the Admin UI.
</Aside>  

## Login instructions for ELN UI (analog for Admin UI)
