## Motivation

When you develop a plugin or an integration for openBIS, you would like to test it on the **real** data of your openBIS instance. At the same time, you don't want a mistake to wipe your production server and you don't like to pollute it with temporary metadata generated by your development.

For this reason, we developed **Instance IO**, a command line tool that allows to export and import the schema (metadata and master data) from an openBIS instance and import it into another. 

## For whom is this tool

This tool offers similar export and import functionalities as the official openBIS master data import and bulk excel import features. The difference is that our tool is designed for **programmatic** use and not for interactive imports.

## How to get and use the tool

The tool is available through our gitlab [repository](https://gitlab.empa.ch/openbis-tools/instance-io). There you will also find the documentation.
