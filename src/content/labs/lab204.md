### Documentation

#### Special rights management

In the case of 204, **we have allowed anyone with the SPACE_ADMIN role to create/edit (but not delete) Object types**.
Normally only Instance Admins can do this.
Permissions belong to roles, not people.
This means anyone with SPACE_ADMIN rights can create/edit types, i.e. can create/edit (but not delete) Object types (since everyone is SPACE_ADMIN of their own SPACE in the ELN).

For more detailed information you can check [here](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-documentation/configuration/optional-application-server-configuration.html#changing-the-capability-role-map) the documentation for the default capabilities associated with each role in openBIS.

**To move objects from one Space to another, power user rights are necessary**, a regular user cannot do that.
To find out **how to assign power user rights to an existing user check [here](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-admin-users/admins-documentation/user-registration.html#register-users-from-the-admin-ui)**.

**ATTENTION**: Be aware that the user registration in the Admin Interface at Empa is different than in ETH documentation, as seen [here](https://scientificit.empa.ch/research_data_management/openBIS/2_Empa_Documentation/For_Admins/add_user/).
Please, read the ETH documentation link starting from point: _10. Multiple roles can be assigned to a user_.
