CSCS User Environments (uenv) provide scientific applications, libraries and tools on Alps.

User environments are SquashFS files that store a compressed directory tree containing all of the software, tools and other information like modules and libraries required to provide a rich environment.

Each environment contains a software stack, comprised of compilers, libraries, tools and scientific applications, built using [Spack](https://spack.io/).

To learn more about `uenv` and how to run them, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.cscs.ch/build-install/uenv/) by CSCS.

This recipe will focus on building a custom user environment either locally or via CSCS CI/CD.
Either way, a user environment is built from a set of **recipes** (YAML files), that define the compilers and software packages to be installed, along with configuration of modules and environment scripts the environment will provide to users.

In this recipe, we will install a Python package ([ppafm](https://pypi.org/project/ppafm/)) that provides a library and scripts to perform scanning probe microscopy simulations.
The full recipe can be found [here](https://github.com/empa-scientific-it/empa-spack/blob/main/uenv/ppafm/v0.3.2/daint).

## Locally

The main piece of software required to build a user environment is [Stackinator](https://github.com/eth-cscs/stackinator).

### Getting Stackinator

<Steps>

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eth-cscs/stackinator.git
    ```

2. Checkout to a released versions since the `main` branch includes features for Spack v1.0, and may break older recipes.

    ```bash
    git checkout v4.0
    ```

3. Run the bootstrap and make the binary available in your `PATH`

    ```bash
    ./bootstrap.sh
    export PATH="<stackinator-install-path>/bin:$PATH"
    ```

</Steps>

### Prepare the build environment

<Steps>

1. Move to another folder (e.g., one folder above from where you cloned Stackinator's repo) and clone the repository with the cluster configurations

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eth-cscs/alps-cluster-config
    ```

    These are recipes (YAML Spack files) that define the toolchains to compile and install the software described in our recipe.

2. If you never built a uenv, it's a good idea to have a build cache to speed up subsequent builds. First, create an empty folder (in your `$SCRATCH` directory)

    ```bash
    mkdir -p $SCRATCH/uenv-cache
    ```

3. Use a Spack installation to create generate GPG keys that are used for signing and verifying the packages

    ```bash
    # Create a  .keys directory accessible only to you
    mkdir $SCRATCH/.keys
    chmod 700 $SCRATCH/.keys

    # Generate the key
    spack gpg create <your-name> <your-email>
    spack gpg export --secret $SCRATCH/.keys/spack-push-key.gpg
    chmod 600 $SCRATCH/.keys/spack-push-key.gpg
    ```

4. Create a file to configure the build cache

    ```yaml
    // cache-config.yaml
    root: $SCRATCH/uenv-cache
    key:  $SCRATCH/.keys/spack-push-key.gpg
    ```

    Note the path of this config file as it will be needed by Stackinator when building the uenv.

</Steps>

### Build the uenv

<Steps>

1. In a folder of your choice, clone the `empa-spack` repository that contains the recipe for the `ppafm` package

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/empa-scientific-it/empa-spack.git
    ```

2. Request an allocation on a cluster's computing node to avoid hogging the resources on the login nodes

    ```bash
    srun -A <account> -n1 -t180 --pty bash
    ```

3. Run `stack-config` (provided by Stackinator) to prepare the build directory. Adjust all the paths according to the previous steps

    ```bash
    stack-config --recipe /path/to/empa-spack/uenv/ppafm/v0.3.2/daint \
                 --build /dev/shm/$USER/ppafm \
                 --system /path/to/alps-cluster-config/daint \
                 --cache /path/to/cache-config.yaml
    ```

4. Perform the Build

    ```bash
    cd /dev/shm/$USER/ppafm
    env --ignore-environment PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:`pwd`/spack/bin make modules store.squashfs -j32
    ```

    The call to `make` is prepended by `env` to unset all environment variables and make the build reproducible.

</Steps>

### Installing the software

The `make` command generates two versions of the software stack in the build path:

1. A `store` directory, the full Spack environment with everthing that's been built and installed
2. A `store.squashfs` file, a compressed filesystem image that can be mounted on a cluster node

The simplest method to install the software stack is to copy the `store` directory to the desired location (preferly out of the `$SCRATCH` folder).

The default installation directory is specified in the `config.yaml` file of our recipe.
In this example, we're using the default `/user-environment` directory, which should be used for deployment on Alps.

```yaml
// config.yaml
name: ppafm
spack:
    commit: releases/v0.23
    repo: https://github.com/spack/spack.git
store: /user-environment
description: Library and scripts to perform scanning probe microscopy simulations based on a CP2K calculation
```

## Via CSCS CI/CD

Using `uenv build` command.
