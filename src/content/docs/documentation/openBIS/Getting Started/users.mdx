title: Tips for Users
---

Dependending on the way you are registered to your openBIS, you have [default rights to some openBIS folders](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-admin-users/admins-documentation/user-registration.html#default-roles-assigned-in-eln).
The instance admin of your openBIS manages your user rights and therefore your rights can diverge from the default.
Contact your instance admin if you need help with your rights in openBIS or you can contact our openBIS support via [email](mailto:openbis-support@empa.ch).

- Check the ETH documentation on these topics:
  - How to create projects and experiments in the openBIS [Lab Notebook](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/lab-notebook.html)
  - How to [share your projects with others](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/lab-notebook.html#share-lab-notebooks-and-projects). Please be aware that **you can only add Empa employees which have access to your openBIS and that the User Id is the e-mail adress written with "_AT_" instead of @, for example: anusch.bachofner_AT_empa.ch**
- Check our Empa specific documentation:
  - usage of [ipads with openBIS](/documentation/openbis/how-to-and-use-cases/ipads/) in the section with use cases from labs
