## RDM training

Training scientists in RDM is crucial for ensuring the integrity and reproducibility of scientific research.
It involves teaching you how to organize, store, and share data in a way that is ethical, secure, and efficient.

This training can enhance the quality of your work, as well-structured and well-managed data are easier to analyze and interpret.
Moreover, it fosters collaboration and transparency in the scientific community, as data managed properly can be easily shared and reused by others.

The training is provided every 6 months and it consists of several 2h online sessions with exercises.
There are no registration requirements.
More details follow here and on the intranet, in advance of each training, with enough time for registration.
