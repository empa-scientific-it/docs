title: Software Deployment
---

Deploying software to a server is a common task these days, and at Scientific IT, we're experts in this field.
Whether you need to deploy your tool on a server (physical or virtual) or in the cloud, we're here to assist you.

## Technologies

We have experience with a wide range of technologies, including:

### Software

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) with pre-configured environments (e.g. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)).
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).
- Various databases ([MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), etc.).
- Web servers ([Apache](https://apache.org/), [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/), etc.).
- [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/) and [AiiDAlab](https://www.aiidalab.net/).
- [openBIS](./openbis).
- [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

### Platforms

- Linux ([Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), etc.)
- [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows)

### Deployment

- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

## What we deliver

Typically, our deliverables are the deployed software with the deployment scripts supported by documentation.
If needed, we can also provide you with the server infrastructure.
See more on that in the [Compute section](../compute/index.md).

## No further support policy

Due to the limited resources, we cannot provide support for the deployed software.
Once deployed and delivered by us, it is the responsibility of the user to keep it alive and running.
We can, however, help you with wiping the server and redeploying the software from scratch, if needed.
