title: Why Research Data Management?
---

Research Data management (RDM) addresses the organization, capture, storage, preservation, and sharing of research data created during a research project.
It comprises researcher's strategies for caring for their data and decisions concerning what to do with the data upon completion of a project.
This results in publishing data in a data repository for long-term access and archiving.
