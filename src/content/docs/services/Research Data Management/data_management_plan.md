title: Data Management Plan
---

Writing a Data Management Plan (DMP) is a requirement of funding agencies.
In this section, you will find information about these requirements and links to various templates for DMP's.

## DMP templates and support

### Empa internal support
- **Empa SNF DMP template [here](https://www.empa.ch/documents/10817006/0/Empa+DMP+Template+for+SNF/9e33c4e4-dbad-4371-8e05-fb5fd81dcf58)** is a Word document that contains specific answer options for the SNF questions, distinguishing between working with or without openBIS and with regard to sensitive data.
- **Please request the minimum 10'000 CHF SNF funding for RDM**, which includes money for data preparation, archiving and publishing on FAIR data repositories like Zenodo (it can be more money if you have good reason). It is necessary to give SNF some explanations how the RDM costs are composed. Check the **template for RDM costs [here](https://www.empa.ch/documents/10817006/0/SNF_costs_RDM_basis_v1/10be2210-70c7-4075-8671-7a1938dbaef8)** for information and tranfer it into the SNF propsal (change it where necessary).
- In case of further questions contact us via [e-mail](mailto:scientificit@empa.ch) (e.g. for more help about Horizon Europe DMP)

### External templates and tools
- [The Digital Curation Centre (DCC)](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/dmponline) provides an online tool to fill in and maintaining DMP. It has a collection of all recent DMP for various founding agencies [dmponline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/)

## The Swiss National Science Foundation
The [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch) (SNF) values research data sharing as a fundamental contribution to the impact, transparency and reproducibility of scientific research.
In addition to being **carefully curated and stored**, the SNF believes research data should be **shared as openly as possible**.
The SNF therefore expects all its funded researchers

- to store the research data they have worked on and produced during the course of their research work,
- to share these data with other researchers, unless they are bound by legal, ethical, copyright, confidentiality or other clauses, and
- to deposit their data and metadata onto existing public repositories in formats that anyone can find, access and reuse without restriction.

Research data is collected, observed or generated factual material that is commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to document and validate research findings.

### Guidelines
- SNF will make all DMP publicly available at the end of the project. The submitted DMP for application can still be a draft version, but it has to be finalised before the end of the project.
- SNF supports the sharing of research data in data repositories with **up to CHF 10â€˜000.- please request the full amount**, check the **template for RDM costs [here](https://www.empa.ch/documents/10817006/0/SNF_costs_RDM_basis_v1/10be2210-70c7-4075-8671-7a1938dbaef8)** for information and tranfer it into the SNF propsal (change it where necessary!).
- SNF requires that the research data used in the publication be made available in a public FAIR data repository before the publication is submitted. Check the **FAIR public repositories recommended by SNF [here](https://www.snf.ch/en/WtezJ6qxuTRnSYgF/topic/open-research-data-which-data-repositories-can-be-used)**
