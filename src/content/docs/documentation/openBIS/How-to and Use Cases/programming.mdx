title: Programming in openBIS
---

This section contains advice and information about programming applications connecting or using openBIS.
It is mostly a collection of reference material and code snippets that could prove useful in your development work.

## Internal gitlab group

We maintain a [gitlab group](https://gitlab.empa.ch/openbis-tools) with various tools for openBIS.
Please check it out, you might find a project covering your needs or at least inspiration for your own project.
If you want to contribute with your project, please feel free to add your project there.

## Test instances

If you need a test instance to develop software for openBIS, we recommend to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
See the guide [here](/documentation/openbis/how-to-and-use-cases/programming/docker) on how to get started.

If you have an empty test instance and would like to set it up programmatically, check out our [instance-io](https://gitlab.empa.ch/openbis-tools/instance-io) project on gitlab.
