import LabSelector from 'src/components/LabSelector.astro';

Each lab has a dedicated page with its openBIS links, and some specific documentation, if available.

Lab members can edit their page by adding markdown documents to their folder on Empa Gitlab and then creating a merge request. 
If you don't know how to do this, please [email us](mailto:openbis-support@empa.ch).

Please, select your lab number from the dropdown list:
