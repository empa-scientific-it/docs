title: Empa documentation for Instance Admins
---

Instance Admins can manage the openBIS meta data structure via the Admin UI and support the users in their lab. 
[Scientific IT](../../../../index.md) supports the instance admins in their work, support forms are available [here](../../Support.md).

The following documentation is Empa specific and requires an Instance Admin:

- [Register a new user](./add_user.md) to your openBIS instance
- [Our process for feature requests](../For_Admins/development_request_process.md). Contact us via [support form for new feature](../../Support.md) and we will help you with the steps.
