## What we do

Our team is skilled in modern software development practices.
We are competent in a variety of technologies, programming languages, and concepts.

We have experience in many facets of software development, particularly:

- Backend development
- Front-end/web development
- HPC
- Deployment using Docker containers
- Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)

## Best practices

Our team can teach you how to write code that's not only efficient, but also easy to understand, following the best practices in software development.
Whether you're new to coding or looking to get even better, we're here to make sure your software is both effective and well-crafted.

We can support you in many aspects of modern software development practices, for example:

- Modularization, packaging and distribution of software
- CI/CD
- Software architecture

For a brief introduction to software architecture, you can check the slides [here](https://gitlab.empa.ch/empa-scientific-it/software-architecture-training).

[Contact us](/docs/support/) for a first discussion shall you need assistance with any of these topics.

If want us to have a closer look at your project, you can book a slot in our [office hours](/docs/support/#how-to-book-a-meeting) for dev support sessions.

## Internal developments

We develop and maintain a number of open-source packages in python as well as in other languages.
The following list is not exhaustive, so don't forget to check our repositories for the latest releases.

### General-purpose tools

### OpenBIS

View our OpenBIS related repositories on [GitLab](https://gitlab.empa.ch/openbis-tools)

### GraphSearch

We are working on a internal data search tool in collaboration with the EPFL Graph project.
A version of their implementation can be found [here](https://graphsearch.epfl.ch/).

## ORD projects

Our team is also activately participating in a number of [ORD](https://open-research-data-portal.ch/) projects, aiming to enhance Open Reserach Data practices and FAIR data principles.
Some of them are:

- **API Interoperability**: Implement open API-based interfaces between the SciCat data repository and ELNs in the ETH Domain.
- **iLog**: Integrated instrument and inventory logbook for experimental science labs.
- **[OpenEM](https://www.openem.ch/)**: A consortium of Swiss electron microscopy facilities to improve ORD practices.
- **[PREMISE](https://ord-premise.org/)**: A project that aims to build the infrastrucutre required to support the adoption of ORD standards and practices.
- **Storage API**: Introduce a common storage access API based on industry standards among the ETH Domain institutes.
