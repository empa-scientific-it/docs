### Documentation

#### Special rights management

In the case of 201, **we have allowed anyone with the SPACE_ADMIN role to create/edit (but not delete) Object types**.
Normally only Instance Admins can do this.
Permissions belong to roles, not people.
This means anyone with SPACE_ADMIN rights can create/edit types, i.e. can create/edit (but not delete) Object types (since everyone is SPACE_ADMIN of their own SPACE in the ELN).

For more detailed information, you can check the documentation [here](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-documentation/configuration/optional-application-server-configuration.html#changing-the-capability-role-map), for the default capabilities associated with each role in openBIS.
